## Red Gold AI solution for better culture and privacy protection

**Transparent culture protection** 

Typical solution for culture protection - or morderation - for social network is performed at server side and therefore non transparency. With our solution, the moderation is shifted toward client side so that users can monitor the evaluation process of their content.

**Voting based culture for community**

Instead of providing a fixed set of cultural rules to users, our AI solution allows a user group to form their own culture rule set which is more flexible and oriented to individual group.

**Privacy protection** 

Our AI system is design to protect users' privacy by allow users to censor their content prior to submit to server storage. The censoring method is the agreement between system and user so that AI system still perform as its desired functionality.

> Based on thosed advanced conceptual approachs, we introduce our attempt for addition values for social network:

**Privacy for influence**  In our system, users gain influene as the result of their contribution for the volume of real value content as the exchange of their own privacy.
